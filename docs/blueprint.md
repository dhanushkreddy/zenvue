## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#673AB7), to give the app a high-tech and trustworthy appearance, but while avoiding a corporate or financial association.
- Background color: Light violet (#F3E5F5), providing a muted contrast to the primary color.
- Accent color: Purple-blue (#3F51B5), offering a distinct highlight for interactive elements without straying too far from the app's overall violet theme.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, provides a modern, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text. 
- Utilize Material Design icons for a consistent and familiar look.
- Employ a bottom navigation bar on mobile and a side/top navigation for web, aligning with Material Design, Apple HIG, and Amazon UI patterns.
- Incorporate subtle animations for state changes (e.g., adding to cart, ad rating) to provide clear user feedback.
